# Covalent Gas Tracker

## Details
Create a single-page application (SPA) using the GoldRush Kit that enables visitors to enter their Covalent API key and select a blockchain and event type from 'ERC20 token transfers', 'Native token transfers', and 'Uniswap V3 swap events'. The application will present the user with gas prices related to the specific event type they have chosen for the selected chain.

## Deliverables
- Front-end code of the SPA using existing GoldRush components and ones you build.
- Deployment of the application on a hosting platform like Vercel.
- User input sections for the Covalent API key, chain selection, and event type.
- A display area showing real-time 1, 3, and 5-minute average gas prices related to the selected chain and event type.
- Use https://ui.shadcn.com/ and https://www.tremor.so/ to render data, similar to how GoldRush Kit does now.
- Documentation detailing the use of the page and steps to obtain an API key.
- A statement or best practice guide on the secure usage and non-retention of the user's API key.
